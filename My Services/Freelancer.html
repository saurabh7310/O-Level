            <p>A freelancer is an individual who earns money on a per-job or per-task basis, usually for short-term work
                as an independent contractor. A freelancer is not an employee of a firm and may therefore be at liberty
                to complete different jobs concurrently by various individuals or firms unless contractually committed
                to working exclusively until a particular project is completed. </p>

            <h3>Understanding Freelancer</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph_use">
            <p>Typically, freelancers are considered independent workers and may do their contract work full-time or as
                a side job to supplement full-time employment, time permitting. Freelancers, as independent contractors,
                typically require signed contracts for the job to be done and will agree to a predetermined fee based on
                the time and effort required to complete the task. This fee may be a flat fee or a per-hour, per-day, or
                per-project fee, or some other similar measure.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A freelancer tends to work in the creative, skilled, or service sector, such as in film, art, design,
                editing, copywriting, proofreading, media, marketing, music, acting, journalism, video editing and
                production, illustration, tourism, consulting, website development, computer programming, event
                planning, photography, language translation, tutoring, catering, and many more.</p>
